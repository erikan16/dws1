			    <h2>History</h2>

                    <p>The dandy horse, also called Draisienne or laufmaschine,
			        was the first human means of transport to use only two wheels
			        in tandem and was invented by the <em>German Baron Karl von Drais</em>.
			        It is regarded as the modern bicycle's forerunner; Drais introduced
			        it to the public in Mannheim in summer 1817 and in Paris in 1818.
			        It's rider sat astride a wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and
			        pushed the vehicle along with his/her feet while steering the front wheel.</p>
			        <p>The first mechanically-propelled, two-wheeled vehicle may have been
			        built by <em>Kirkpatrick MacMillan</em>, a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, although
			        the claim is often disputed. He is also associated with the first
			        recorded instance of a cycling traffic offense, when a Glasgow newspaper
			        in 1842 reported an accident in which an anonymous <q>gentleman from
			        Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design</q> knocked
			        over a little girl in Glasgow and was fined five shillings.</p>
			        <p>In the early 1860s, Frenchmen <em>Pierre Michaux</em> and <em>Pierre Lallement</em>
			        took bicycle design in a new direction by adding a mechanical crank
			        drive with pedals on an enlarged front wheel (the velocipede).
		            Another French inventor named <em>Douglas Grasso</em> had a failed prototype
                    of <em>Pierre Lallement's</em> bicycle several years earlier. Several inventions
                    followed using rear-wheel drive, the best known being the rod-driven
                    velocipede by Scotsman <em>Thomas McCall</em> in 1869. In that same year, bicycle
                    wheels with wire spokes were patented by <em>Eugène Meyer</em> of Paris.
                    The French <em>vélocipède</em>, made of iron and wood, developed into the
                    penny-farthing (historically known as an <q>ordinary bicycle</q>, a
                    retronym, since there was then no other kind). It featured a
                    tubular steel frame on which were mounted wire-spoked wheels with
                    solid rubber tires. These bicycles were difficult to ride due to their
                    high seat and poor weight distribution. In 1868 <em>Rowley Turner</em>, a sales
                    agent of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company (which soon became the
                    Coventry Machinist Company), brought a Michaux cycle to Coventry,
                    England. His uncle, <em>Josiah Turner</em>, and business partner <em>James Starley</em>,
                    used this as a basis for the <em>'Coventry Model'</em> in what became Britain's
                    first cycle factory.</p>

                <p>Bicycles can be categorized in many different ways: by function,
                    by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means
                    of propulsion.</p>
                <p>The more common types include:</p>

                <!-- un-ordered list -->

                <p>Unicycles, tricycles and quadracycles are not strictly bicycles,
                    as they have respectively one, three and four wheels, but are often
                    referred to informally as <q>bikes</q>.</p>

                <p>The bicycle has had a considerable effect on human society,
                    in both the cultural and industrial realms.</p>

                <p>Around the turn of the 20th century, bicycles reduced crowding
                    in inner-city tenements by allowing workers to commute from more
                    spacious dwellings in the suburbs. They also reduced dependence on
                    horses. Bicycles allowed people to travel for leisure into the
                    country, since bicycles were three times as energy efficient as
                    walking and three to four times as fast.</p>
                <p>A number of cities around the world have implemented schemes
                    known as bicycle sharing systems or community bicycle programs.
                    The first of these was the White Bicycle plan in Amsterdam in 1965.
                    It was followed by yellow bicycles in La Rochelle and green bicycles
                    in Cambridge. These initiatives complement public transport systems
                    and offer an alternative to motorized traffic to help reduce
                    congestion and pollution. In Europe, especially in the
                    Netherlands and parts of Germany and Denmark, bicycle commuting
                    is common. In Copenhagen, a cyclists' organization runs a Cycling
                    Embassy that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing.
                    The United Kingdom has a tax break scheme that allows
                    employees to buy a new bicycle tax free to use for commuting.</p>
                <p>In the Netherlands all train stations offer free bicycle parking,
                    or a more secure parking place for a small fee, with the larger
                    stations also offering bicycle repair shops. Cycling is so popular
                    that the parking capacity may be exceeded, while in some places
                    such as Delft the capacity is usually exceeded. In Trondheim in
                    Norway, the Trampe bicycle lift has been developed to encourage
                    cyclists by giving assistance on a steep hill. Buses in many
                    cities have bicycle carriers mounted on the front.</p>
                <p>There are towns in some countries where bicycle culture
                    has been an integral part of the landscape for generations,
                    even without much official support. That is the case of <em>Ílhavo</em>,
                    in Portugal.</p>
                <p>In cities where bicycles are not integrated into the public
                    transportation system, commuters often use bicycles as elements
                    of a mixed-mode commute, where the bike is used to travel to and
                    from train stations or other forms of rapid transit. Some students
                    who commute several miles drive a car from home to a campus parking
                    lot, then ride a bicycle to class. Folding bicycles are useful in
                    these scenarios, as they are less cumbersome when carried aboard.
                    Los Angeles removed a small amount of seating on some trains to
                    make more room for bicycles and wheel chairs</p>
                <p>Some US companies, notably in the tech sector, are developing
                    both innovative cycle designs and cycle-friendliness in the workplace.

                        high tech worker.</q></p>
                <p>Bicycles offer an important mode of transport in many developing
                    countries. Until recently, bicycles have been a staple of everyday
                    life throughout Asian countries. They are the most frequently used
                    method of transport for commuting to work, school, shopping, and
                    life in general. In Europe, bicycles are commonly used.
                    They also offer a degree of exercise to keep individuals healthy.</p>
                <p>Bicycles are also celebrated in the visual arts.
                    An example of this is the Bicycle Film Festival, a film
                    festival hosted all around the world.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Experiments done in Uganda, Tanzania, and Sri Lanka on hundreds
                    of households have shown that a bicycle can increase a poor
                    family's income as much as 35%. Transport, if analyzed for the
                    cost-benefit analysis for rural poverty alleviation, has given
                    one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road
                    investments in India were a staggering 3-10 times more effective
                    than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy
                    in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to
                    increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The
                    bicycle, in that sense, can be an important poverty-eradication
                    tool in poor nations</p>

                    <h3 id="female" >Female emancipation</h3>
                </div>

                <p>The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility,
                    contributing to their emancipation in Western nations.
                    As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access
                    to the personal freedom that bicycles embodied, and so the
                    bicycle came to symbolize the New Woman of the late 19th century,
                    especially in Britain and the United States. The bicycle craze
                    in the 1890s also led to a movement for so-called rational dress,
                    which helped liberate women from corsets and ankle-length skirts
                    and other restrictive garments, substituting the then-shocking
